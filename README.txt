Project log:
I have attempted multiple times trying to fix my pipe functions but I have not been able to read the operands and operator properly from ".usp" files in the same directory. I have tried to implement everything to the best of my abilities. Functions have error checks where necessary and memory allocations are used and freed appropriately. The program compiles properly using the makefile that I've created.
